<p><b>Philosophy on Community</b></p>
<p>Our lab is committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all in science, especially for people from historically excluded groups.  Equity and inclusion interact to form major barriers that exclude groups of people from science.  Over my career, I have learned about these barriers by regularly attending student-organized discussions, protests, and organizing workshops. I have learned that barriers to equity often originate from a lack of diversity and inclusion across the academic hierarchy. Through this process, I learned how important it is to develop a deep appreciation for listening and become a better advocate for all members of the community. I believe that the future of science depends upon having a diverse faculty that share the same experiences and backgrounds as the student body. Being a professor is a privilege, and I will use it to ensure people have access to and ongoing support in academia.</p>

<p><b>Eric Riddell</b>, Principal Investigator (riddell@unc.edu) </p>
<p>My name is Eric, and I am an Assistant Professor in the Biology Department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After college, I  abandoned my ambition of becoming a dentist and moved to the Galapagos Islands. I spent several months working at hotels and teaching English, but then I got an opportunity to work on a deserted island studying a colony of Nazca boobies. In graduate school, I dove headfirst into the field of environmental and ecological physiology, and I haven't looked back. I love what I do, and I also love spending time with my family, friends, and fishing.</p>

<p><b>Braulio Assis</b>, Postdoc</p>
<p>I am an evolutionary ecologist who studies how animal populations respond and adapt to a changing world. To address this question, I have explored various study organisms including fish, orb-weaving spiders, and lizards. In the Riddell Lab I work with lungless salamanders to understand how they respond to environmental change. In my free time I enjoy Brazilian music, the bass guitar, cooking, and swimming.</p>

<p><b>Ellen Keaveny</b>, Postdoc</p>
<p>Coming soon!</p>

<p><b>Issi Burger</b>, PhD Candidate</p>
<p>I joined the Ecophysiology Lab after completing my Masters in the Conservation Physiology Lab at Mississippi State University, focusing on amphibian reproductive physiology. While at Iowa State, I will be modeling species distribution of salamanders while also aiming to better understand their evolutionary and physiological ecology. When I’m not in the lab or in the field, I can be found reading, exploring the outdoors, or spending time with my partner and three pups.</p>

<p><b>Tamara Tyner</b>, PhD Student</p>
<p>My name is Tamara and I am joining the Ecophysiology Lab after studying and working as a Forensic Anthropologist for the past few years. Before my anthropology days, I studied organismal biology and stable isotopes in aquatic food webs at the University of Kansas. I'm very excited to return to bio and explore the physiology of bumble bees! Outside of researching, I enjoy cooking, gardening, and any sort of adventure I can jump into with friends and family.</p>

<p><b></b>Savannah Weaver</p>, PhD Student</p>
<p>I am pursuing my PhD in the Ecophysiology Lab after spending my Master’s investigating the hydration and evaporative water loss of lizards in the Physiology Ecology of Reptiles Lab at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. While at UNC Chapel Hill, I will be focusing on hydric trade-offs for anurans, their acclimation capacity, and how that will relate to their extinction or resilience to climate change. In addition to the mind-blowing physiology of reptiles and amphibians, I love the great outdoors, my mischievous kitties, and good food.<p>
